# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Ensure all cross-functional roles are represented (Developers, QA, UX/UI, DevOps, etc.)
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- Consider role-specific retrospectives for deep dives on specialized processes

For onboarding improvements, use feedback from [Cross-Role Onboarding Best Practices](octoacme-cross-role-onboarding.md).

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync
