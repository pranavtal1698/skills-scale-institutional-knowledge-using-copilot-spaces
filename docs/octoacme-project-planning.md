# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (all relevant roles)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map
7. Ensure all necessary cross-functional roles are engaged (UX/UI, DevOps, Security, Support, etc.)

For requirements gathering best practices, see [Requirements Clarification Checklist](octoacme-requirements-clarification.md).
